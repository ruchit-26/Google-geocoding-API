# Google-geocoding-API
use of Google GeoCoding API to retrieve data and then use Google Maps to visualize the data.
# Run the geoload.py to lookup all of the entries in where.data and produce the geodata.sqlite. Then run geodump.py to read the database and produce where.js. You can run the programs and then scroll back to take your screen shots when the program finishes. Then open where.html to visualize the map.
